# Jodok's Favourite Recipes

This personal project collects the favourite recipes of my boyfriend and display them in simple cards.
The idea was to make it simple to access the recipe before and during cooking time. The second goal was to have a unique place to adapt the recipe with our own notes and measurement system that we are used to.

## Aprendizados

As my first personal project using React, I was able to understand better how to use Hooks, build my own JSON file to centralize data and how to access them. Understanding of how to manage states and use reactDOM. I was able to test UI libraries like Material UI, Bootstrap and finally Tailwind, which I prefer the most. It was a good practice to understand how javascript is applied into a real application.

Several challenges were feaced during this project, as a self-taught person I had to study 'in loco' everytime I wanted to implement a new feature. Figure out how to build SPA applications using React Route DOM and even change npm to yarn after problems with dependencies peers during deploy in vercel.

Also, I had no figma to follow so it took me more time testing how design would be until I find the current version attractive.
